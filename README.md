Neptune_Magnetosphere
===============

This was a class project in which I created a 3D simulation of Neptune's Magnetosphere.
To run: run triton_sim.m. Other files support the 3D simulation. You can then use the Rotate3D tool in Matlab.

Color Descriptions:
The Yellow and Dark Blue halves of the center sphere are the Light and Dark sides of Neptune, respectively.
The thick Red and Blue lines are the Magnetic North and South poles.
The Blue dotted lines are an estimation of the magnetopause.
The Light Blue and Black lines are L-Shell examples.
The Light Green line is Triton's orbit.
The thin Red line is Voyager 2's trajectory.

All numbers are in Neptune Radii. The dropdown box on the left allows you to change Neptune's orientation through examples.
